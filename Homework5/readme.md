Do the following problems from chapter 10 of the Data Mining book. You can find a link to a PDF of that chapter in the syllabus.
  * 10.2 (k-means)
  * 10.10 (BIRCH). Note that you'll have to read about the OPTICS algorithm in the text.
  * 10.12 (density-based clustering)
  * 10.18 (constraints and clustering) For this problem I'm just looking for you to propose some ideas. In addition to what's asked for in the book, say something about how your proposed modifications impact the computational complexity of the clustering algorithm.
